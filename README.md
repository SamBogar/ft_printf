A recreation of the famous library function printf

This project proved to be a remarkably time-consuming venture, not because of any particular programming challenge, but rather because of the massive collection of illogical idiosyncrasies of the real printf.

I have never hated a collection of code more than I learned to hate the real printf. Seriously, don't use it. It is sloppy with it's memory usage, and does not behave well when used with any other printing function.
For what it's worth though, mine is better. A little slower, but better.
